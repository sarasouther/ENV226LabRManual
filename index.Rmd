# Introduction

This course surveys the central concepts in ecology: evolution, population dynamics, community interactions, biogeochemical cycling, and limiting factors, as well as how those factors are measured, quantified, and interact with drivers of global environmental change. This course is required for the B.S. in Environmental Sciences degree program, and also the B.S. in Environmental and Sustainability Studies degree. This course acquaints students with foundational concepts and theories in ecology and provides a broad basis for more advanced courses in subdisciplines and applications of ecology. 

A critical part of ecological research is developing practical and analytic skills. Most ecologists and data scientists use R statistical software. Learning how to manage, manipulate and analyze data in R will serve your undergraduate career and beyond! In ENV 226 lab, we will ease you into using R for all your data needs!

**How to use this resource**

Each chapter in this online book corresponds to a lesson that will help you in lab. The order of labs may change due to weather conditions or other factors, so please consult your TA on which chapter you complete in each week!
