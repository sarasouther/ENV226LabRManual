# Selecting statistical tests

## A foray into statistics

We've talked about data types and describing data. This week we are applying concepts that we learned last week to select (and run) a statistical analysis. When conducting an analysis, a dataset will contain one or more **response variables** (aka y-variables, dependent variables) and one or more **explanatory variables** (aka x-variables, independent variables). Explanatory variables are used to explain variation in response variables. The data types of the explanatory and response variables determine which statistical test we use.

**Pick the explanatory and response variable** 

Imagine that we want to identify areas that support high numbers of plants from the genus *Mitella*. We hypothesize that *Mitella* occurrence is positively related to water supply (i.e., the number of *Mitella* plants goes up as water availability increases). 

**Answer**

1. **Response Variable (Y)**: This is the variable we are trying to explain or predict. In the case of *Mitella*, it could be the number of *Mitella plants* in a specific area.
2. Explanatory Variable (X): This is the variable that we believe influences or explains the variation in the response. In your example, this would be water availability.

## Selecting statistical analyses

Below, you will see a very simple decision matrix for selecting statistical analyses. Let's walk through how to use it to select statistical tests.

### Using the decision matrix

**Both variables are categorical**: Use a G-test (or chi-square test) to see if the frequency of categorical outcomes differs across categories of the explanatory variable.
**Example**: If we were studying whether *Mitella* plants are found more frequently in shaded vs. sunny areas (categorical), we would use a G-test.

**Explanatory variable is categorical, response variable is continuous**: Use a t-test (or ANOVA for more than two categories).
**Example**: If water availability is grouped into categories (e.g., “low,” “medium,” “high”) and you want to test its effect on *Mitella* abundance (continuous response variable), a t-test or ANOVA would be appropriate.

**Note**: ANOVA or ANalysis Of VAriance is just like a t-test except you are comparing more than 2 groups, in this example we would use an ANOVA for comparing  “low,” “medium,” “high” watering regimes, but a t-test for testing "watered" vs "not watered".

**Explanatory variable is continuous, response variable is continuous**: Use linear regression.
**Example**: If you measured the amount of water in milliliters and counted the number of Mitella plants, linear regression could help determine the relationship between water availability and Mitella abundance.

**Explanatory variable is continuous, response variable is categorical**: Use logistic regression.
**Example**: If you’re modeling the presence or absence of Mitella plants (categorical response) based on continuous water availability, logistic regression is the correct choice.

## Statistical tests 

Let's practice these statistical tests in R!  

### G-test (Categorical Response and Categorical Explanatory Variable)

Scenario: You are studying bird nest preferences in a forest. You want to know if birds prefer nesting in different tree species (oak, pine, or maple).

	•	Response variable: Nest presence (Yes/No)
	•	Explanatory variable: Tree species (oak, pine, maple)
	
Run the code in R.

### t-test and ANOVA (Continuous Response and Categorical Explanatory Variable)

#### t-test
Scenario: You want to compare the weight of two species of frogs (Species A and Species B) to see if there’s a significant difference in weight between them.

	•	Response variable: Frog weight (grams)
	•	Explanatory variable: Species (A or B)
	
#### ANOVA (Continuous Response and Categorical Explanatory Variable with More Than Two Categories)

Scenario: You are studying the growth of plants in three different habitats: Desert, Forest, and Wetland. You want to compare plant height across these habitats.

	•	Response variable: Plant height (cm)
	•	Explanatory variable: Habitat (Desert, Forest, Wetland)

### Linear Regression (Continuous Response and Continuous Explanatory Variable)

Scenario: You are studying how the number of fish in a river changes with water temperature. You want to model the relationship between water temperature (°C) and fish count.

	•	Response variable: Fish count
	•	Explanatory variable: Water temperature (°C)
	
### 5. Logistic Regression (Categorical Response and Continuous Explanatory Variable)

Scenario: You want to study the probability of a specific bird species’ presence in different areas based on elevation. The response is whether the bird is present or absent.

	•	Response variable: Bird presence (Yes/No)
	•	Explanatory variable: Elevation (meters)

## Assignment

Here are the descriptions of 4 datasets (they are loaded in your R file). For each one, select the correct statistical test, then modify the code from your examples and run the test. 

### Turn-in 

1. Results statements including:

- The correct test statistics

2. Associated figures with correct figure legends.
